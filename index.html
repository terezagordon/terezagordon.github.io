                    <div class="sectionContent">
                        <p>I recently became interested in the use of computer graphics, especially in the use of films, 
                            because I find the progression to more realistic CGI over time to be very fascinating. I 
                            think this mainly stemmed from watching quite a lot of movies and TV shows in 2019. I also like 
                            coding programs because I think they can be quite fun to make while it challenges you. I think my 
                            interest part of IT began when I was in primary school when we did Robotics. In that class we would
                            program the Lego Mindstorms to do cool things, as well as make very simple games using Scratch. In 
                            high school, I did one class where one of our projects was to make a street light project using Arduino
                            and I thought that that was quite an interesting experience.
                            <br><br>
                            I thought that RMIT would be a good university for STEM degrees because from researching online 
                            this was something the university focused on primarily and was known for. I also heard that it 
                            was more hands on than other universities, so you weren’t just learning theory but also applying what
                            you learned, which I think would be a good way to learn especially for STEM courses. From looking 
                            online to what students had said, the university has good connections for future job opportunities 
                            and provides a lot of support for you when you do try to find work placements.
                            <br><br>
                            I think we will learn skills that don’t really get taught well, if at all, such as working in teams, 
                            communicating with each other and other practical skills needed in the workplace. I also think we will
                            be learning about technology and how it may change in the future, such as the use of Web 3.0, blockchain 
                            technology on a larger scale, AI, as well as privacy and the use of consumer data, digital footprints, and security.

                        </p>
                        <p>I thought this job was interesting because you get to work on the software that is used by the students 
                            and staff for their animation and visualisation projects. In this position, you get to work directly with
                            the student to help them use the software and make their workflow much easier. This appeals to me because 
                            you get a better understanding of how people work, and you are developing programs centred around their 
                            needs. I also like this job position because you are indirectly learning how people who are animators and 
                            create visualisation projects go about doing their job.</p>
                        <h3>Skills I have</h3>
                        <p>I did a year of the Bachelor of Computer Science last year before having to change to studying via OUA, so 
                            I have some experience with creating simple programs in Java and Python, as well as working with databases. 
                            During the duration of the time I spent studying in my other degree, I also had the opportunity to learn about 
                            and use git. I have also worked a bit in HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make some websites.</p>
                        <h3>Skills I Need</h3>
                        <p>Some of the skills required for this role are communication skills, the ability to work in a team, problem 
                            solving skills. An understanding of the computer programming processes used when animation and visualisation 
                            projects are being produced is also needed. It is also important to have experience using software development
                            workflows that are used in professional settings. It is also important for the applicant to have completed an 
                            undergraduate qualification or training in areas related to computer science, 3D animation and/or computer graphics production.</p>
                        <h3>Learning Plan</h3>
                        <p>To obtain the skills needed, I will be researching how animation and visualisation projects are made and the 
                            technology behind it. I plan to teach myself how to use software such as Maya, Nuke and Houdini which are 
                            commonly used by CG and VFX companies, so that I can have a better understanding of the software. This will 
                            be very important to because part of the job position is to make it easier for the artists to use the software. 
                            I will also try to create smaller projects on my own to put myself in the shoes of the artists so I can understand 
                            the limitations of the software while trying as best as possible to improve their workflow and support them. I 
                            also want to improve my skills in Python, so I will try to create small projects that can be used in the software to add to my portfolio.</p>

                        <p>I think the results are somewhat accurate because most of the results were close to half, with the 
    exception of the Introversion/Extroversion scale which heavily skewed towards introversion, because I don’t think I am ever 
    on one side of the scale, completely and all the time. In line with the judging personality, I prefer having a clear 
    idea of what is going to be happening, however, I don’t mind changing things to suit others in my team. I think when you 
    look at the personality types of others, it can allow you to communicate and work together in a team much more effectively.</p>

                                                <p>I don’t think the test results for learning styles is very useful, because 
                            I learn differently depending on what I am studying. However, I generally tend to find aural learning 
                            a very difficult way to learn, unless it is listening to an audiobook because I stop listening very 
                            quickly. I don’t think these result will influence my behaviour in a group setting very much because I 
                            can easily look for anything I don’t understand on the internet, where various sources explain the 
                            same idea in different ways. For me, I think that I should try to explain things in different ways 
                            because some people may prefer learning in a specific way. This can help to reduce the time it takes for 
                            someone to understand a concept, so that you can spend more time actually doing work.</p>

                            very much open to hearing the thoughts and opinions of others and doing what they want. In relation 
                            to the low conscientiousness score, I think I find it hard to prioritise things because when I get 
                            new information it just seems more important to me, which kind of throws me off track and I get quite 
                            a bit lost. For neuroticism, if something goes wrong, then I can move on quite quickly even if I can’t 
                            find a solution for it.Because I like listening to the opinions, I tend to go with what others want 
                            because I usually feel like their ideas are better than mine. So, I think I should definitely try to 
                            contribute more so people who don’t like being the only one sharing and doing all the work when it 
                            comes to thinking of ideas.</p>

                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>The proposed idea is to create a digital frame that will allow users to see photos they have taken on 
    their phones, cameras, or other devices in a frame without having to print them. The user view one photo or a slideshow of 
    photos which are stored on the cloud on the digital frame. The digital frame can be controlled by the users device to change 
    the image to a different image.</p>

                        <h2>Motivation</h2>
                        <p>This project will be interesting because users do not have to print out all their photos. Using a 
    digital frame streamlines the process of changing images, because it is very simple to add and remove photos from an album of 
    photos. This saves more time than the traditional method where you had to take out the back of the frame and replace the photos.</p>

                        <h2>Description</h2>
                        <p>The user needs to upload their images of choice onto Dropbox, which needs to be configured with command 
    line program Rclone to be able to download the images and sync them to the Raspberry Pi. Images can be uploaded to Dropbox 
    from any device. When this is done, the images will cycle through a slideshow and loop multiples. Or, if the user chooses they 
    can just use one image on the digital photo frame. </p>

                        <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
                        <p>An LCD screen is needed in order for the user to be able to see the images. A Raspberry Pi 3 is a small 
    computer which will be what powers the digital photo frame. A power supply such as a micro-USB power adapter is needed to make 
    sure the Raspberry Pi is charged. A keyboard, micro SD Card of at least 8GB, mouse and HDMI cable are all needed to operate 
    the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi OS will need to be installed onto the SD card. Users will upload photos to Dropbox. Rclone 
    is an open source command line program that will be syncing photos uploaded to Dropbox and the digital photo frame. A frame is 
    needed to place the LCD screen in.</p>

                        <h2>Skills Required</h2>
                        <p>The Raspberry Pi OS is based on the Debian Linux, so some basic knowledge in needed. However, this 
    should not be difficult as the information is quite accessible online. An old laptop screen or monitor can be used, however, if 
    a new one is purchased it may be expensive to be a decent quality one. It will not be very feasible to find the Raspberry Pis 
    as many are out of stock due, and they are also quite expensive to buy online. The frame, can be purchased, but if there are 
    no frames that match it, a custom one will either need to be purchased or made. Software and programs such as Dropbox and 
    Rclone are all free and easy to use. Micro SD cards, keyboards, mouses, and HDMI cables are all very inexpensive and easy to 
    find in stores.</p>

                        <h2>Outcome</h2>
                        <p>If the project is successful, users will be able to easily see photos they have taken on a photo frame 
    without the need to even print them out and frame them. Users will not have to constantly take out the SD card in order to add 
    or remove photos on it to see different images displayed. Users will be able to frame animated images which would not be 
    possible on a traditional photo frame.</p>
